# TODO

- switchable notification types per product
- reset alarm notifications at device boot with broadcast receiver
- handle empty container notifs
- addable capacity on the go (maybe remove the container capacity from products?)
- splash activity to better handle alt icon (no background service?)
- resize app icon foreground (too much zoomed)
- try other tertiary color in theme (this yellow is ugly)
- import and convert legacy products notifications settings
- schedule alerts on import legacy db
- force scroll calendar list to first item when list changes
- editable container left capacity
- when adding product, the user have to set the past date of intake, or the next intake date. Mandatory to add the product!
- Improve advanced mode arrow UI in product adding dialog

# DONE

- selectable hour of intakes
- customisable notification content
